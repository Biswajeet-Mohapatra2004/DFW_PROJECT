Anomaly Detection in Network Packets

This project focuses on developing a Python-based solution to analyze network traffic from a PCAP file using Scapy. The primary objective is to identify anomalous behavior in network packets based on specific rules that indicate potential malicious activity. The identified anomalies are recorded in a structured report.

Key Features:

1. Traffic Analysis:

Identifies traffic using non-standard ports for TCP and UDP.

Flags excessive traffic indicative of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.



2. Packet Size and Frequency Checks:

Detects unusually large packets exceeding the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).

Highlights IP addresses with excessive packet transmission.



3. Protocol-Specific Anomalies:

Detects unsolicited ARP replies.

Flags unusually large DNS responses.

Identifies excessive ICMP Echo requests.



4. Connection Abnormalities:

Detects TCP SYN floods based on a high number of SYN packets.

Flags IPs performing port scans on multiple ports.



5. Automated Reporting:

Generates a report.csv file detailing the anomalies for each device.

Computes the Malicious Device Probability (MDP) as a percentage for each device.




This tool provides network administrators and security professionals with insights into potentially harmful activities within their networks, enabling prompt action against security threats.
